# Software Quiz Client Questions

## Design

1. Do you want the quiz to be displayed all at once or individually?
2. Does each question type need to be displayed as such to the candidate, or is it okay for the candidate to infer it visually (e.g. - Check all would have check boxes versus radio buttons)?
3. Does the client get feedback on answers (i.e. - know if they got an answer correct or incorrect)?
4. For the free response types, is a single word, multiple words or paragraph format? If this is open to phrases or paragraph type responses, grading would have to be manual.
5. Does the app need real world authentication (google auth, industry standard user and password handling), or can it be as simple as storing a user and password without concern?
